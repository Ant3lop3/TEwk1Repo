This is my first webpage assignment project with the TechEducators!

Here are the sources I used in order to help create/fix on my html/css code:

There where two occasions where i have used Claude.AI for a couple of sections, this is illustrated with comments within the css file.

Reflection:

Learnt alot by doing this project, some ups and downs when getting things to work. Although there are aspects of it that I'm not that happy with, such as optimisation in general.
when zooming in and out of the webpage everything goes all over the place, which isn't right. I also haven't tested it on my phone. Had a frustrating moment towards the end when I inserted a footer, then alot of
white space around the edges appeared. I struggled to get rid of it on the right side so resorted to prevent the user from scrolling right.
I need to learn more about SVH,SVW and REM, what they do exactly and when to use them. I noticed on the example website we had (SpaceY) that it used REM. Also need to learn specifics on flex boxes,
cause at times when i was using the console to manipulate the element nothing was happing. most of the time I ended up using position: absolute or relative, then I would adjust the elements position via Top and Left followed by
a number and REM. I feel like although this worked, I imagined some experienced front-end dev shaking his head saying noooo. This may have been the root cause of the whole optimisation issue, then again maybe not I don't know.

However, I did enjoy making this basic site
